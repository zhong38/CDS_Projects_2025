The raw and featurized data are within the /Group8_CDS_Data directory. The 388 raw coordinate files have been compressed into silanols_vicinal.zip, simply unzip this directory in order to access the files. 

The two notebooks within the main directory (Group8_CDS_DimensionalityReduction.ipynb and Group8_CDS_Featurization.ipynb) contain the polished code for this project. The draft notebooks (where members did their initial work) are within the /Group8_CDS_DraftNotebooks directory.
