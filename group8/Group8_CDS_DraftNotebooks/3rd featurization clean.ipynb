is)\n","\n","# How can we make features to include at least one (ideally both) of these changes in the features\n","# this would allow for the principal components to have interpretable units as it will be a combination of these geometrically understood features\n","# Getting the two outward oxygen angles is somewhat easy\n","\n","# could be just having all the angles of each Si
